                    <p>
                        Hello!
                        I'm Satsuki Takashima, a young japanese raised in italy.
                        Very excited to participate in new projects/startups and grow together! Due to the
                        multi-culturality between Japan and
                        Italy, I feel that I have a more open mind that can surely be helpful to you and be a bridge
                        between Europe and Asia.
                        I'm also a Front-End, Back-End Junior Web Developer!

                    <h3>Passions and interests</h3>
                    <p>I have no real work experience, so I would like to talk about my interests
                        and passions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Product design</li>
                        <li>Product industry</li>
                        <li>Car and Motorcycle industry</li>
                        <li>IT technologies</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These are my main interests. I like product design because I want to "release physical objects"
                        in the world that are <strong>innovative</strong> and
                        <strong>beautiful</strong> and that will be <strong>unforgettable</strong> over the years.
                        Since childhood, I have liked to create things. I like making
                        projects where I create
                        products, and cool things. From researching materials and planning to building prototypes.
                        Many
                        times I had
                        complications during my projects, but I never gave up and managed to achieve the desired result.
                        If there were problems, I always looked for solutions, even searching on internet and asking
                        experts.
                        Now I'm learning Architecture at Politecnico di Milano to grow my project skills!

                        <h4>Satsukikaze Works</h4>
                        <p>"Satsukikaze Works" Project is an anime/game merchandise project. Launching the "Satsukikaze
                            Works" brand selling unique nixie tube clocks made with my own hands.
                        </p>
                        <p>This project started with market research and a feasibility check. I had found similar
                            products at very high prices,
                            with demand from a small niche of fans.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next step was cost calculation and the selection of suppliers. Selecting suppliers from
                            all over the world and
                            trying to reduce material costs in order to lower the selling price without affecting
                            product quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The last step was building a web shop and advertising it. Created a web shop on <a
                                href="http://booth.pm">booth.pm</a> (the biggest Japanese handmade
                            merchandise site) and registered a Twitter account for advertising.
                        </p>

                        </a>
                        <h4>Cinetic Bikes</h4>
                        <p>
                            Cinetic Bikes was a fixed bike brand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first thing I did was to look for someone who could help me with this project. I
                            found a
                            friend of mine who is a
                            bicycle lover. With him we started thinking about what bike would be easy to build,
                            aesthetically beautiful, and at an
                            affordable price.
                            So we started searching the Internet to find a bike frame supplier. Having found our
                            supplier, the next step was to find
                            all the other components of the bike. taking cost in mind, we were able to get all the
                            components.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most exciting step was the assembly. seeing our bike take shape. Whoa..
                            While we were waiting for the paint job, I worked on the name and logo for the bike.
                            "Cinetic Bikes", the Logo came out
                            great.
                            We also wanted to do the dedicated website but there was a problem. we didn't know how
                            to do
                            it. and that's where I
                            started thinking about <a href="#boolean">Boolean</a>...
                            For the site we had decided to give up on it, and start selling it on a popular used
                            bike
                            website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After a few days, our first bike was sold.
                            Yes! but a little too long to sell one...
                            We forgot about advertising on social media! we didn't even have the budget for that...
                            they
                            were not in our costs
                            estimations. this was a huge mistake.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, we were happy!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But here comes the biggest problem with the project.
                            We had no time.
                            We were high school students, just before the graduation exam, and it was not easy to
                            find
                            all the time for this.
                            So we decided to drop the project and leave it as an experience for our future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I learned how to talk to suppliers, organize the work, think about how to improve the
                            product, which are the demands,
                            and how advertising is important for a brand.
                        </p>
                        <p>This helped me a lot for my future projects.</p>
